# Student-Management-System-Java

A Student Management System built using Java and NetBeans IDE, designed to handle student details and manage records efficiently. The project is split into two main branches:

### CUI--v (Command Line User Interface Version)
This branch contains the command-line interface (CUI) version of the Student Management System. It focuses on basic student management functionality without a graphical interface.

### GUI--v (Graphical User Interface Version)
This branch features the GUI version of the Student Management System. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage student details, enrollments, and grades. In addition to the GUI, it also includes the implementation of an SQL Server database to manage the backend data storage. 

The system allows users to interact with the student records using forms for various operations, such as adding students, updating details, and viewing student records.
